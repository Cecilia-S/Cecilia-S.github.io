						<h2>Week 5</h2>
						<br/>
						<h4>5 Levels  (July 16 — July 20)</h4>
						<p>The report structure is clearer and we designed a 5-level system to represent the degree of complexity and completeness of the report. Level 1 and level 5 are easy because they are pretty clear-cut, but levels 2-4 are still fuzzy. I wish we could finish this part as soon as possible so we can work on other stuff.</p>
						<p>It was very interesting to attend the reading group on Thursday so I get to know a little bit more about this field. We talked about various things about the integration of technology in the life of disabled people. Anat told us the story of a nonvocal girl’s friend seeing the girl’s always accompanied assistant as a friend, too. She notified the importance of respecting the fact that human is part of the process of helping the handicapped. I never thought about that and it was definitely food for thought. </p>

						<h2>Week 4</h2>
						<br/>
						<h4>Awesome Table  (July 9 — July 13)</h4>
						<p>This week we gathered some ideas on the report and discussed for revisions. I felt I was kind of stuck just because I don’t know how specific should the ideas be. The major progress this week is that I set up the Google site for the project. It was easy to create the set, but the table that displays the images that lead to reports took me some time. I used the Awesome Table online app and messed with the template for quite a while. Anyway, now the table has 35 apps for display. I think later we’ll have a total of 100 apps and maybe separate reports for Android apps.</p>
						<p>I went to the Museum of Pop Culture on Saturday. It was a cool idea and people were having fun playing video games in the Indie Game Room. My favorite display is the one of Horror Movies. I loved the skulls and zombies around the room. Besides, it was not that scary as it’s intended as a part of the museum. The downside was that I didn’t know that much of American pop culture (or any kind of pop culture), so I definitely didn’t get the most of the experience.</p>

						<h2>Week 3</h2>
						<br/>
						<h4>Report Ideas  (July 2 — July 6)</h4>
						<p>I focused on gathering ideas on the report this week. Basically, the report on an individual app would demonstrate the most necessary features of an app to a user from the perspective of accessibility. We are planning on divide the report into two big parts, one for VoiceOver/TalkBack, and one for Access Control/Switch Scanning. The  hardest part is separating the users’ needs from more technical stuff. I am constantly wavering between the user perspective and programming perspective. </p>
						<p>On Sunday, I went to the first ever Amazon GO in Seattle. It was absolutely worth it. Amazon GO is a new style of convenience store where the user can swipe in with an app and buy anything they want without checking out. The app keeps track of the shopping list in a virtual cart, and the user can receive a receipt shortly after. The whole experience was great. I was so excited see this kind of technology. The only downside is that the store is relatively small. I wish Amazon would consider to build bigger grocery store with the same technology.</p>

						<h2>Week 2</h2>
						<br/>
						<h4>Assessments Begin  (June 25 — June 29)</h4>
						<p>This week I started the actual assessment of mobile applications, which turned out to be pretty tedious work. A single assessment took more time than I expected. However, I felt more comfortable as at least I knew I was doing (kind of). Anat said she would give me some past reports as examples for what we would have have as an end result, so I guess next week I would have a plan in head when I keep assessing the apps.</p>
						<p>I was nervous about the team meeting on Tuesday, but it turned out that the meeting was quite casual. Everyone spoke a little bit about his or her accomplishments and challenges last week and Anat talked about what she learned from a meeting she’s been to. </p>
						<p>On the personal side, I learned to do some housework……On Thursday, I accidentally put too much dishwashing liquid in the machine. It was a big mistake! Bubbles were everywhere. I spent almost an hour to clean things up, and the dishes were not even that clean!! Well, people learn from their mistakes, don’t they?</p>

						<h2>Week 1</h2>
						<br/>
						<h4>Planning and Preparing  (June 18 — June 22)</h4>
						<p>The first week finally came! The main thing I did is to understand the project and to start preparing and plan for the whole program. After a discussion with Anat and reading a paper from a past student project, I began to understand our goals. To start, I needed a questionnaire to ask specific questions for the assessment. I adapted the Google form for Android app assessment and replaced some of the features with the equivalent in the iOS system. Later, we could use the result to compare accessibility features between iOS apps and Android apps and probably find out if there is any difference between open sourced and proprietary developing environment.</p>
						<p>Seattle is a beautiful city. I lived in an apartment close to the university. The apartment itself is neat and my roommate seems nice, the only thing that bothers me is that street not far away looks sketch and some college students next door party almost everyday. I’m planning to travel a lot on weekends when I’m still in Seattle, but it is a bit hard when I don’t have a car.</p>
