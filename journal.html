						<h2>Week 10</h2>
						<h4>August 20 — August 24</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>The End!!!</h4>
						<p>I can’t believe this is the last week! We finalized the 5 stages (previously 5 levels) in the report following a clinical model. The report template was adjusted based on the stages and most charts in the spreadsheet are ready to go. I tried to make a sample report using Emma’s data, but the end result shows that there’s still issues waiting to be solved. Here are the things need to be worked on in the future: 1) Emma’s assessment provides some inaccurate answers that are most likely caused by misunderstanding the question. 2) Some charts in the report are not well presented. 3) The forms should have additional questions. 4) We need to assign an unique id to each user. 5) Some concepts are not well-defined. 6) More data need to be generated.</p>
						<p>Anyway, Anat and I had lunch together and discussed some future plans. I will keep working on this project. The summer research itself was fun and I learned a lot about research in general and myself as a person. Hopefully I’ll use of the skills I learned later in my research career.</p>

						<h2>Week 9</h2>
						<h4>August 13 — August 17</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>Infographics  </h4>
						<p>It seems like that I have to transform my infographics to a Google Slide as it is much easier to share and edit for other members of the project. Anat provided some good advices and I tried to generate the charts and visuals from the data in the form automatically. Right now most of what I did was hard coding, but we are planning to add an identifying code later to the form so it can be truly automatic.</p>
						<p>Other students in the lab are leaving as their programs are finished. I was excited to attend a poster presentation session with Emma explaining her project. Everyone there was excited to talk about their topics and it was interesting to watch. We had a grouping lunch together as a farewell meeting. It was actually a rare opportunity for us to get to know each other better.</p>

						<h2>Week 8</h2>
						<h4>August 6 — August 10</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>Infographics</h4>
						<p>This week I began to work on the infographics. I finished the VoiceOver part using a program called Visme. It was easy to use with handy charts and icons. During the weekends, Anat looked it over and provided me with some helpful comments. I still need to work on the part for Access Control though.</p>
						<p>During Monday’s group meeting, we watched some videos from one of the lab’s project. It’s a children’s playground that involves cars for children with mobility issues. The cars they had have sensors that could detect objects and give hints to the children which direction to go. One of the goals of the project is to provide inexpensive commercial toy cars for children who need wheelchairs. This is an on-going program and they are trying to think of more interactive activities to implement with the cars. </p>

						<h2>Week 7</h2>
						<h4>July 30 — August 3</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>Multi-level Pie Chart</h4>
						<p>The Google forms are all renewed, but the whole process of editing is very slow because the form is too long. I think there’s room for more questions and improvements later. Details like these are hard to finish at once. I made a sample of a multilevel pie chart using javascript and I need to think about the colors on it later. The chart would display information about labels, including default, correct, and meaningful ones. I’ll work on the Infographics more next week. Right now I’m not sure what charts could I add to the reports.</p>
						<p>I did not travel on the weekends and took the spare time to relax and sleep. This week is a lot colder than the previous one, mainly because it’s cloudy always. Hopefully the sunny days will come back.</p>

						<h2>Week 6</h2>
						<h4>July 23 — July 27</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>New Google Form</h4>
						<p>Now it is the time to rethink of the work we’ve done and begin to revise some of the previous ideas. I edited the new iOS Google Form according to the report template we have in mind. Once we finalize it, I’ll also change the form for Android. Anat told me that this is a iterative process of doing new things and revisit the old ones. That was a big relief for me since I was having trouble making progress. Overall, I think we are moving forward now.</p>
						<p>I visited the Seattle Central Public Library on Saturday. It was an amazing building, but I did not stay long enough to actually read a book, maybe next time. People there were nice and I loved the book spiral where you could walk downstairs without staircase.</p>

						<h2>Week 5</h2>
						<h4>July 16 — July 20</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>5 Levels</h4>
						<p>The report structure is clearer and we designed a 5-level system to represent the degree of complexity and completeness of the report. Level 1 and level 5 are easy because they are pretty clear-cut, but levels 2-4 are still fuzzy. I wish we could finish this part as soon as possible so we can work on other stuff.</p>
						<p>It was very interesting to attend the reading group on Thursday so I get to know a little bit more about this field. We talked about various things about the integration of technology in the life of disabled people. Anat told us the story of a nonvocal girl’s friend seeing the girl’s always accompanied assistant as a friend, too. She notified the importance of respecting the fact that human is part of the process of helping the handicapped. I never thought about that and it was definitely food for thought. </p>

						<h2>Week 4</h2>
						<h4>July 9 — July 13</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>Awesome Table</h4>
						<p>This week we gathered some ideas on the report and discussed for revisions. I felt I was kind of stuck just because I don’t know how specific should the ideas be. The major progress this week is that I set up the Google site for the project. It was easy to create the set, but the table that displays the images that lead to reports took me some time. I used the Awesome Table online app and messed with the template for quite a while. Anyway, now the table has 35 apps for display. I think later we’ll have a total of 100 apps and maybe separate reports for Android apps.</p>
						<p>I went to the Museum of Pop Culture on Saturday. It was a cool idea and people were having fun playing video games in the Indie Game Room. My favorite display is the one of Horror Movies. I loved the skulls and zombies around the room. Besides, it was not that scary as it’s intended as a part of the museum. The downside was that I didn’t know that much of American pop culture (or any kind of pop culture), so I definitely didn’t get the most of the experience.</p>

						<h2>Week 3</h2>
						<h4>July 2 — July 6</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>Report Ideas</h4>
						<p>I focused on gathering ideas on the report this week. Basically, the report on an individual app would demonstrate the most necessary features of an app to a user from the perspective of accessibility. We are planning on divide the report into two big parts, one for VoiceOver/TalkBack, and one for Access Control/Switch Scanning. The  hardest part is separating the users’ needs from more technical stuff. I am constantly wavering between the user perspective and programming perspective. </p>
						<p>On Sunday, I went to the first ever Amazon GO in Seattle. It was absolutely worth it. Amazon GO is a new style of convenience store where the user can swipe in with an app and buy anything they want without checking out. The app keeps track of the shopping list in a virtual cart, and the user can receive a receipt shortly after. The whole experience was great. I was so excited see this kind of technology. The only downside is that the store is relatively small. I wish Amazon would consider to build bigger grocery store with the same technology.</p>

						<h2>Week 2</h2>
						<h4>June 25 — June 29</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>Assessments Begin</h4>
						<p>This week I started the actual assessment of mobile applications, which turned out to be pretty tedious work. A single assessment took more time than I expected. However, I felt more comfortable as at least I knew I was doing (kind of). Anat said she would give me some past reports as examples for what we would have have as an end result, so I guess next week I would have a plan in head when I keep assessing the apps.</p>
						<p>I was nervous about the team meeting on Tuesday, but it turned out that the meeting was quite casual. Everyone spoke a little bit about his or her accomplishments and challenges last week and Anat talked about what she learned from a meeting she’s been to. </p>
						<p>On the personal side, I learned to do some housework……On Thursday, I accidentally put too much dishwashing liquid in the machine. It was a big mistake! Bubbles were everywhere. I spent almost an hour to clean things up, and the dishes were not even that clean!! Well, people learn from their mistakes, don’t they?</p>

						<h2>Week 1</h2>
						<h4>June 18 — June 22</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>Planning and Preparing</h4>
						<p>The first week finally came! The main thing I did is to understand the project and to start preparing and plan for the whole program. After a discussion with Anat and reading a paper from a past student project, I began to understand our goals. To start, I needed a questionnaire to ask specific questions for the assessment. I adapted the Google form for Android app assessment and replaced some of the features with the equivalent in the iOS system. Later, we could use the result to compare accessibility features between iOS apps and Android apps and probably find out if there is any difference between open sourced and proprietary developing environment.</p>
						<p>Seattle is a beautiful city. I lived in an apartment close to the university. The apartment itself is neat and my roommate seems nice, the only thing that bothers me is that street not far away looks sketch and some college students next door party almost everyday. I’m planning to travel a lot on weekends when I’m still in Seattle, but it is a bit hard when I don’t have a car.</p>
